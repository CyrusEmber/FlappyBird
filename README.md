````# FlappyBird
I need to create bird, background and pillars that are moving

SPACE for the bird to jump
SHIFT + N for new birds

SHIFT + = for accelerate
SHIFT + BACKSPACE for pause

SHIFT + O for new generation when there are limited birds

SHIFT + S for save the current best model, 
only applicable when there is only one bird left
